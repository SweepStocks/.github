# SweepStocks

SweepStocks is a sweepstake kind of game, but with a major difference, you are allowed to sell your bet during the football season. The winners are the ones that guesses who will be the champion, the 10th place and the 16th place of the major football leagues around the world.

Every bet in a team is 100% added to the pool prize and equally distributed to the winners. The price of each bet is always cheaper then the next one. This is designed to allow users to sell their bets during the season when they believe a team is over or undervalued, making their bets a stock kind of asset whose projected dividends are the probability of winning the prize, therefore, suscetible to the football teams performance, instead of financial reports, which is much more fun.

This is done by using the Polygon blockchain network which allows the automatic payment to the rightful winners in a completely decentralized manner. The blockchain technology allows for nearly perfect bets, without any intermediation from a third party, only the direct relation between betters. The position of the football teams are given by Chainlink oracles, preserving the security and decentralization of the game.

Finally, the owners of this contract can only change the IPFS address to fetch the metadata of each football team. The funding of the project comes from a small fee of 0.1% per bet sold. The only way to transfer any value from this contract is by paying the winners. This contract is also not pausable nor destructable.
